# Challenge name: Quiz

**1. Are trusted websites immune to XSS attacks?**
Solution 1: Yes they are safe because the browser checks the code before executing.
Solution 2: Yes because Google has got an algorithm that blocks malicious code.
Solution 3: No because the script that is executed will break through the defense algorithm of the browser.
*Solution 4: No because the browser trusts the website if it is acknowledged trusted, then the browser does not know that the script is malicious.*

**2. When do XSS attacks occur?**
Solution 1: Data enters a web application through a trusted source.
Solution 2: Data enters a browser application through the website.
*Solution 3: The data is included in dynamic content that is sent to a web user without being validated for malicious content.*
Solution 4: The data is excluded in static content that way it is sent without being validated.

**3. What are Stored XSS attacks?**
*Solution 1: The script is permanently stored on the server and the victim gets the malicious script when requesting information from the server.*
Solution 2: The script stores itself on the computer of the victim and executes locally the malicious code.
Solution 3: The script stores a virus on the computer of the victim. The attacker can perform various actions now.
Solution 4: The script is stored in the browser and sends information to the attacker.

**4. What are Reflected XSS attacks?**
Solution 1: Reflected attacks reflect malicious code from the database to the web server and then reflect it back to the user.
*Solution 2: They reflect the injected script off the web server. That occurs when input sent to the web server is part of the request.*
Solution 3: Reflected attacks reflect from the firewall off to the database where the user requests information from.
Solution 4: Reflected XSS is an attack where the injected script is reflected off the database and web server to the user.

**5. Is JavaScript the only way to perform XSS attacks?**
Solution 1: Yes you can only make use of tags through JavaScript.
Solution 2: Yes otherwise you cannot steal cookies.
Solution 3: No there is ECMAScript too.
*Solution 4: No there are many other ways. Like HTML, Flash or any other type of code that the browser executes.*
